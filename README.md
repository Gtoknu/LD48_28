=======
You are a sleepyhead that is trying to wakeup, those pillows, warm milk and sheeps want you to sleep more! Try to get all the clocks and beat the 10 levels :) 

[Keys] 
You can use the arrows to move, for convenience, ZXCVAQ and SPACE also jump. 

[NOTE] 
If you want to reset your progress, press R at the main menu. BEWARE you'll have to begin from the first level again. 

[NOTE2] 
You can resize the window as you like, the game is prepared to pratically any resolution that has sense. 

[NOTE3] 
The game was ported to Android today 20/12/2013. When on Android, a touchscreen controller will appear :) (no changes were made to the other builds)

## A T T E N T I O N, TIPS: 

As a lot of you said it is too hard to beat, here are some tips: 
1st - go fast, really, dont wait for enemies to spawn 
2nd - cups of warm milk follow you but they're not so clever. you can trick them, and jumping on their head is easy 
3rd - never let they corral you 
4th - sheeps are fast as hell, they also jump much higher than you, killing them is not that hard, but if there are more than one sheep behind you, most of the time fleeing is the best option ( just let them jump over you :D ) 
5th - pillows are jerks, as stated by a commenter :P they wait for you when you're near, and if you're near enough, they'll jump to catch you. The strategy is: get close, wait for the jump, fastly go backwards and jump on their head! 

I hope you guys manage to beat it now (i beat all levels already, i swear xD)
